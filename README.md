# Problem statement
**Project title: Provide Insights to the revenue team in the hospitality domain**

This data analytics resume project challenge was conducted by Codebasics in the hospitality domain. 
In this case study we analyse the revenue metrics of AtliQ Grands.AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue.

Tasks :
1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

# Analysis

- A list of metrics was provided to define the requirements.
- The primary focus of these metrics was to track revenue performance, guest preferences, and operational efficiencies on a daily basis.
- I have used DAX in Power BI to calculate these metrics.
- A few important ones include :
   1. Revenue
   2. Total Capacity,
   3. Occupancy %,
   4. Cancellation %,
   5. No Show rate %,
   6. ADR (Average Daily rate)
   7. RevPAR(Revenue Per Available Room)
   8. DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights)
   9. DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights)
   10. Week over week change % of revenue, occupancy, ADR, RevPar, DSRN
